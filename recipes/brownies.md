ingredients:
  - (300g) Chocolate
  - (200g) Unsalted Butter
  - (120g) Brown Sugar
  - (200g) Granulated Sugar
  - (4) Large Eggs
  - (180g) AP Flour
  - (80g) Cocoa Powder
  - (1tsp) Salt
instructions:
  - Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease and line a baking tin.
  - Chop the chocolate into chunks.
  - Melt the butter and remove from heat. 
  - Add cocoa powder until melted, and let cool.
  - Whisk eggs & sugar in a separate bowl until pale and slightly thick.
  - Add vanilla extract and the cooled, melted butter mixture.
  - Fold in the flour and salt until combined. Do not over mix.
  - Add the remaining chopped chocolate and mix gently.
  - Pour the batter into the greased tin and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until set and a toothpick comes out with moist crumbs.
  - Let it cool in the pan and refridgerate for 2 hours before cutting it up.
notes:
  - Brown sugar adds chewiness.
  - Whisking eggs & sugar well helps with shiny, crackly top.
  - Chilling deepens the chocolate flavour and makes slicing cleaner.
  - FOR PSYCHOPATHS — For cakier brownies, bake 3-5 minutes longer, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
